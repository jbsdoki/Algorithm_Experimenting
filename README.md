This is a quick experiment in using the Bellman Ford Algorithm to detect an arbitrage opportunity in the forex market. 

This algoritm finds the shortest path in a graph, even if a negative cycle exists.

By taking the exchange rates, and then taking the inverse logarithm (-log(ex1 * ex2)) or (log(1/(ex1 * ex2))) we take the heaviest path (The most profitable) and turn it into the shortest path. If the shortest path has a total weight of less than 1, then the original path was profitable, and exchanging the currencies in that order would create a profit.
